Game entry for the JS13KGames competition

# Falling Down
The theme for JS13KGames 2015 was 'reversed'. Being new to the field of JavaScript and HTML5 game development, I decided to do a simple platform-jumper and turn it upside-down.

# Controls
The game is controlled by mouse only - swipe the mouse from side to side to control our hero.
